# Visualisations

The reason for doing all the transformations and modelling is to build a report of visuals.

There are lots of visuals in Power BI. A few visuals on a page showing the right data with slicers to filter them make a good report. Too many visuals on one page is overwhelming and not useful.

## General Visuals

Aim for 3-4 visuals that tell the story you are trying to tell.

## Tables and Matrix

Tables and Matrix have their place but only work for some audiences so know your audience.

## Slicers

Being able to filter a report is what make a report dynamic and better than fixed report. Syncing slicers, adding a clear all slicers or a reset button completes the package.

## Text Boxes

Text boxes can include values from the report using Smart Narrative features.

## Page Backgrounds

Making a page look professional with borders and boxes will impact a report display performance unless you use a background image.

## Themes

The colour selection for a report is based on the selected theme.
