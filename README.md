# Power BI Introduction

This is the materials I use for Power BI Introduction courses. Power BI updates make keeping notes upto date hard work and Microsoft have a whole team to do that. When there are not notes to cover I will add blog posts and further instructions.

* [Visualisations](<3 Visualisations.pdf>)
