# Publishing and Sharing

Reports get published to workspaces that you have access to. Published reports can be shared in multiple ways using Power BI Apps, SharePoint, Teams and PowerPoint

## Note

Make sure filters, bookmarks and the first page is selected before publishing a report. Make sure you understand the licensing needed for people to view reports. Make sure the reports are delivered to where the business will easily find them.

## Adoption

Moving people away from Excel and Powerpoint charts will take time. Adopting Power BI as a reporting platform across a business takes planning, time and a willingness to listen to your business needs.
